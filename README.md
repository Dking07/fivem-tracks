# FIVEM TRACKS

## DESCRIPTION

### Race tracks for FiveM.

## INFOS

* Tracks made in [cw-racingapp](https://github.com/Coffeelot/cw-racingapp), which for me is the best racing script free out there for qbcore/qbx.
* It is also compatible with [qb-lapraces](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-lapraces) and other scripts that use the same database

## CW-RACINGAPP INSTALLATION

* To import the tracks into cw-racingapp, simply copy the checkpoints of the desired track, open the tablet, go to my tracks, create track, create track with track share, enter the name of the track, paste the checkpoints and confirm.
