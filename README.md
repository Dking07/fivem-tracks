## About the project

**FIVEM TRACKS** is a repository of race tracks for FiveM servers.  
The goal is to have a centralized place with multiple ready-to-use tracks that can be integrated with different race scripts/racing apps.

Perfect for:

- Street racing focused servers
- Servers inspired by styles like NoPixel / Project Homecoming / Project Race / Project Street
- Communities that want to expand their track catalog without reinventing the wheel

---

## Features

- Multiple ready-to-use race tracks
- Simple organization using files in the `tracks/` folder
- Ideal for servers with competitive racing systems

> The loading/usage logic of the tracks depends on the race script you are using in your server.Therefore, you will have to adapt it to your system.
