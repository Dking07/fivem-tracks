# FIVEM TRACKS

## DESCRIPTION

### Race tracks for FiveM.

## INFOS

* Better compatibility with scripts like [qb-lapraces](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-lapraces) and derivatives that have a similar database.
* I currently use [cw-racingapp](https://github.com/Coffeelot/cw-racingapp), which for me is the best racing script out there for qbcore/qbx.
